I made this program with HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, and the GIPHY API/].
This site is made to display a list of gifs based on the subject of the button.
It first displays a still image then when the image is clicked then it will animate.
You can also add more buttons that will search the name of the button on the GIPHY API.

How to Use:

1. Click gif button on top of page.

2. List of still gifs displayed.

3. Click still gif to animate.

Optional:

1. Type in search term into input box.

2. Click Submit.

3. Click new gif button!

Enjoy!
